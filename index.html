        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>During World War II, the Brabant breed faced near-extinction due to disruptions in traditional breeding practices. Fortunately, efforts from organizations like Trekpaard.net helped preserve the breed, and today, while still relatively rare, Brabants are no longer near-extinct.</p>
