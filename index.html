    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Brabant horse, also known as the Belgian Heavy Breed, has its origins in Belgium, with its history dating back to the medieval period. During this time, they were bred specifically for their power, stamina, and docile temperament. They were used for a variety of tasks, including heavy agricultural work, which required a combination of strength and a calm demeanor.</p>
        <p>Brabants played an essential role in farming during the 18th and 19th centuries, helping to revolutionize the agricultural industry with their ability to pull heavy loads for long hours. Their role in the development of modern farming techniques cannot be overstated. The breed was eventually used for a wide range of tasks, including plowing fields, hauling timber, and powering heavy machinery.</p>
        <p>Today, the Brabant is considered one of the foundational breeds for the Belgian draft horse, which has become famous for its strength and versatility in both farming and as a draft horse in various industries.</p>

        <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
        <p>The Brabant draft horse is renowned for its impressive size and muscular build. Typically standing between 16 and 17 hands tall, these horses have a broad, powerful frame that is perfect for heavy labor. Their strong, stocky build and large hindquarters provide them with exceptional pulling power, making them ideal for work like plowing and cart pulling.</p>
        <p>Despite their size and strength, Brabants are known for their docile and calm temperament. They are gentle giants, often described as patient, willing, and highly intelligent. This intelligence makes them easy to train and work with, and their calm nature makes them suitable for a variety of tasks, from farming to carriage driving to horse shows.</p>
        <p>The Brabant's strong, muscular body and well-proportioned frame give them an air of dignity, and their steady, sure-footed movement makes them ideal for hard work and demanding environments.

        <h2>Coat Colors</h2>
        <p>The Brabant breed is known for its wide range of coat colors, including chestnut, bay, grey, flaxen, bay roan, and blue roan. These colors, along with the breed’s robust and muscular build, give the Brabant a distinctive and often kind appearance that is immediately recognizable.</p>
        <p>The most common colors are chestnut and bay, which range from deep, rich hues to lighter shades. Bay roan and blue roan are also fairly popular and contribute to the breed’s stunning variation. While the chestnut and bay coats can have subtle highlights or darker shades, the roan colors often feature a blend of white hairs mixed with the base coat color, giving them a speckled or dappled look.</p>
        <p>The breed’s coat colors are not just aesthetically pleasing but also reflect the breed's versatility in various climates and working environments. Their thick coats, particularly in the winter, help them withstand cold conditions during farm and logging work.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>During World War II, the Brabant breed faced a severe decline in numbers, largely due to the disruption of traditional breeding practices and the widespread scarcity of resources. The wartime period saw many horses lost due to lack of food and care, and the mechanization of farming further diminished the demand for draft horses like the Brabant.</p>
        <p>However, the Brabant breed was not forgotten. Thanks to the efforts of dedicated breeders and organizations, such as Trekpaard.net, the breed was gradually revived. These preservation efforts have been instrumental in maintaining the Brabant’s legacy and ensuring that the breed continues to thrive today.</p>
        <p>While the Brabant is no longer at risk of extinction, it remains a rare breed. The continued efforts to raise awareness about the breed’s history, characteristics, and capabilities have helped keep the Brabant relevant, especially in the world of traditional farming, logging, and driving events.</p>
